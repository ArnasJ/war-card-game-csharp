# Card Game War

## Rules:
- You are playing with full playing card deck without Jokers (52 cards).
- At the start of the game a trump suite gets selected randomly out of 4 available suites (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades).
- A deck is shuffled and each player gets half of the cards.
- Each turn consists of:
  - Both players revealing their topmost card from each of their respective decks.
  - Comparing the card values. Cards are compared by their rank (lowest to highest: 2 to 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace) with trump cards being higher than non-trump cards.
  - Player with a higher ranking card gets both cards and sets them to a separate pile (called score pile).
  - If the cards are of equal value, each player gets his own card back to the score pile.
- A game is played until both players do not have cards.
- At the end of the game a winning player is one that has more cards in their score pile. Equal number of cards results in a tie.


Examples (when the trump suite is Hearts):
- 3 of Hearts > Ace of Diamonds
- 6 of Diamonds > 4 of Diamonds
- Jack of Hearts > 10 of Hearts
